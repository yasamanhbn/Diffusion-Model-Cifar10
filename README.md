# Diffusion Model Implementation on CIFAR-10

This repository contains the implementation of DDPM for image generation on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Diffusion models have shown promising results in image synthesis tasks, and this project aims to provide a simple yet effective implementation for generating high-quality images using the CIFAR-10 dataset.


## Usage

To train the diffusion model, run 'Diffusion_model.ipynb'.
